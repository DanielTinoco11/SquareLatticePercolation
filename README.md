# SquareLatticePercolation

This project focuses on the study of percolation in two dimensions, specifically the site percolation model. The goal is to estimate the critical probability $p_c$ that determines the percolation threshold and to calculate several critical exponents that describe the fractal properties of the system near the percolation transition.
